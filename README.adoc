# Car Claim Demo

== Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of MongoDBâ€™s vector search and advanced text search features to streamline 
and automate the process of declaring a car accident claim. 
It addresses the functional need for insurers and customers to submit and process accident declarations efficiently, 
leveraging semantic search to understand and classify user-submitted descriptions, photos, or documents. 

Using AI-powered vector search, the system automatically associates relevant case data, pre-fills claim forms, 
and retrieves similar past incidents for rapid validation. This approach reduces manual workload, accelerates claims management, 
and enhances the customer experience in vehicle accident reporting.
